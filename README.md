What I learned in week 0

- I learned about the Code Immersives bootcamp.
- I learned that classes already started.
- I learned that I will be allowed to start late because I convinced the staff that I can easily catch up on what I missed.
- I learned that week 0 was mostly terminal and git
- I already know terminal from my Linux experience
- I learned about git, which I haven't used much before
- I learned that I am starting week 1 Tuesday
